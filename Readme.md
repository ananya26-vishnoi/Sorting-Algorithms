<h3>Internal Sorting</h3>
<hr>
Internal sorting are type of sorting which is used when the entire collection of data is small enough that sorting can take place within main memory. There is no need for external memory for execution of sorting program. It is used when size of input is small. Examples:- Bubble sort, insertion sort,quicksort, heapsort.<br>

<h3>External Sorting</h3>
<hr>
External sorting is a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory, usually a hard disk drive.
Examples:- Selection sort, merge sort, counting sort.
